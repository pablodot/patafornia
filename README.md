This repository contains some files i wrote in a rainy day to deploy a beach wacht service, for my pals can see by theirselves WE WONT SURF TODAY EITHER! ðŸ˜‚

Feel free to reproduce and modify, you just need a raspberry pi, a raspicam or a webcam, create a firebase project, a service account and some nice views. For newbies, in raspberry you must install firebase admin tools:

$ pip install --upgrade pip

$ pip install --upgrade firebase_admin

In a few days or years i want to develop edge inference to detect quality of waves, upload data to firestore and maybe email alerts Remember yur time is limited, enjoy!!
